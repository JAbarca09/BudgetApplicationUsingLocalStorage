# BudgetApplicationUsingLocalStorage
This is a budget mobile web application using JavaScript Local storage.

## Bugs To Be Fixed
* Users can have a negative initial budget
* Expenses can be negative 
* A vendor and expense can be entered before a budget is given
* Expenses can be entered without the vendor or inversely with the expense but no vendor!
* When the page is reloaded and there was a previous expense and that expense is removed it causes the balance to be NaN
* Once a budget is entered a new budget can be given and saved to local storage
