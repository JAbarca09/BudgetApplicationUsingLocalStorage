# BudgetApplicationUsingLocalStorage
This is a budget mobile web application using JavaScript Local storage.

## Bugs To Be Fixed
* Error messages should be placed somewhere  else because if there are too many expenses the user will not see an error message appear!
* Vendors with spaced out names. Does the computer remove the right element from the DOM? Also will a long vendor name look right on a card?
* removed an expense and the remaining expense was incorrect or was it the balance? Dont remember that well?
