# BudgetApplicationUsingLocalStorage
This is a budget mobile web application using JavaScript Local storage.

## Bugs To Be Fixed
* Error messages should be placed somewhere  else because if there are too many expenses the user will not see an error message appear!
* Consider changing the color of the trash icon. Maybe white? Or change the background color.
* When page is refreshed and expense is added the balance is incorrect
    * Defining how it breaks: add expenses, remove 1. Refresh the page and then add an expense and the balance should calculate overall user budget set in the beginning - Expense = shows wrong budget
