# BudgetApplicationUsingLocalStorage
This is a budget mobile web application using JavaScript Local storage.

## Bugs To Be Fixed
* When the page is reloaded and there was a previous expense and that expense is removed it causes the balance to be NaN
* Once a budget is entered a new budget can be given and saved to local storage
* When a budget is declared and then the page is refreshed the balance does not correcly show it's 0
