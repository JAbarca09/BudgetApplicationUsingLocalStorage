# Budget Application
It is a simple web-based budgeting application that allows users to set a budget, track expenses, and manage their spending.

## Features
* **Setting a Budget**: Users can input their budget, which is then saved locally to the browser's storage.
* **Expense Tracker**: Enables the addition of various expenses, associating them with vendors.
* **Expense Removal**: The app permits the deletion of specific expenses and vendors.
* **Budget Visualization**: Offers a clear visualization of the remaining budget and overall expenses.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
* **CSS**: For styling the elements and components.
* **JavaScript**: To handle the app's logic and interactions.

## Challenges Encountered
A significant aspect of the application is dynamically creating elements, a process that can be intricate and time-consuming without a framework like React. I realized that leveraging frameworks such as React simplifies and streamlines this process significantly because we let React handle the underlying logic.

## Bugs To Be Fixed
* Add a message when the user clicks on the budget input field when a budget is already declared and the Enter budget button is disabled. Show using the toast that a budget is inputted and too input another you have to use the reset button.
