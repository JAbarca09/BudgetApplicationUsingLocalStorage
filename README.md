# BudgetApplicationUsingLocalStorage
This is a budget mobile web application using JavaScript Local storage.

## Bugs To Be Fixed
* Error messages should be placed somewhere  else because if there are too many expenses the user will not see an error message appear!
* Vendors with spaced out names. Does the computer remove the right element from the DOM? Also will a long vendor name look right on a card?
* When an expense is entered the user has to remove the input fields values for both making it slow for them. How about clearing the input's for them instead?
